Welcome to Part-2.

After accomplishing pcap collection, we will analyse the pcap file using signature and anomaly IDS.
We will use suricata for signature based detection and CNN Deep Learning for anomaly based detection.
*Note: if you haven't collect the pcap yet back to this section https://github.com/fikri210892/gtp-saids
